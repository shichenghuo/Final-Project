# DUDU CAR TOY

DUDU is a TV remote controlled pull toy. DUDU will move in four direction (forward, backward, left and right)

## Summary

DUDU is built by Arduino. When the IR reciver gets the unique signal from one of the buttons on the TV remote, the wheels will start react based on uploaded code.

## Component Parts

/Cardboard as the base for the Arduino circuit.
/TV remote.
/IR reciver.
/H bridge(L293D.)
/Batteries
/Jump wire
/Arduino Uno
/Breadboard
/DC motor

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal
- Week 1: Defining what components will be needed for building DUDU.
- Week 2: Understanding the functions of each component and building up the circuit. Upload the code to the circuit and see whether DC motors and IR reciver works well.
- Week 3: Adjustify the code to make sure the IR signals match with the actions. Putting everything together on the cardboard. Test and record videos.
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

Arduino is a new area for me, it takes me a while to learn how the circuit work and how to connect all the compents in the same board. I remember one time, one of my motor wires was reversed and it was not running. I thought it was a code problem. Finally I found that the input and output of one motor connected to the h bridge was reversed. Learning about how the components will affected by code and check the circuit connections are two biggest challenges for me.
